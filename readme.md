# Kumparan entry test

Here i provide about Social media dashboard, built with:

- React as a frontend view library
- Redux as state management
- Redux Thunk to return dispatch function from action creators
- Bulma as UI Kit
- Webpack as a module bundler

# Instalation

I use local php server to run static data in this project. So if you wanna run it locally, run command:

- yarn dev or yarn watch
- cd dist
- sudo php -S localhost:1000 (or whatever port you want)

If you wanna build it to production mode, just run:

- yarn build

I have push this project to github static page, you can run it on:
https://andreepratama27.github.io/kumparan-entry-test

Unfortunately, I still have issue to configure testing on this project because I prefer to make sure the functionality running well.
